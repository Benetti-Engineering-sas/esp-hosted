# Demo App in C

### Introduction
- This demo application showcases a way to configure control path.
- App is available under directory [c_support/](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support)
- App interacts with [`Hosted Control Library`](../../host/control_lib) using [control path APIs](./ctrl_apis.md).
- API header could be found at [ctrl_api.h](../../host/control_lib/include/ctrl_api.h)

## Sample Applications

The c_support directory contains several applications to interface with ESP devices:

- 1. `test.out` \
Uses **test.c**: Simplistic demo application to test control RPC APIs

- 2. `stress.out` \
Uses **stress.c**: Internal stress testing for control path APIs

- 3. `hosted_shell.out` \
**hosted_shell.c**: Interactive shell interface extended over test

- 4. `hosted_daemon.out` \
**hosted_daemon.c**: Background daemon for network management

These apps work over [Hosted Control Library](../../host/control_lib/) as base.\
These apps also use **app_custom_rpc.c**, which provides simple Custom RPC implementation for application-specific communication

## 1. Demo App (test.c)

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. With IEEE802.11d enabled, the country info of the AP to which the station is connected is used. E.g. if the configured country is US and the country info of the AP to which the station is connected is JP then the country info that will be used is JP. If the station disconnected from the AP the country info is set back to the country info of the station automatically, US in the example.
> 2. With IEEE802.11d disabled, then the configured country info is used always.
> 3. When the country info is changed because of configuration or because the station connects to a different external AP, the country IE in probe response/beacon of the soft-AP is also changed.

### How to run
It uses APIs present in [ctrl_api.h](../../host/control_lib/include/ctrl_api.h). User should first modify configuration parameters in [ctrl_config.h](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/ctrl_config.h). Then run `make` in [c_support/](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support) to compile `test.c`.

Please execute `test.out` as below.

```sh
$ make
$ sudo ./test.out \
	[ get_sta_mac_addr      || get_softap_mac_addr     || set_sta_mac_addr          || \
	  set_softap_mac_addr   || get_wifi_mode           || set_wifi_mode             || \
	  get_ap_scan_list      || sta_connect             || get_sta_config            || \
	  sta_disconnect        || set_softap_vendor_ie    || reset_softap_vendor_ie    || \
	  softap_start          || get_softap_config       || softap_connected_sta_list || \
	  softap_stop           || set_wifi_powersave_mode || get_wifi_powersave_mode   || \
	  set_wifi_max_tx_power || get_wifi_curr_tx_power  || \
	  ota </path/to/esp_firmware_network_adapter.bin> || \
	  enable_wifi || disable_wifi || enable_bt || disable_bt || get_fw_version || \
	  set_country_code || set_country_code_enabled || get_country_code || \
	  get_dhcp_dns_status || send_packed_data__only_ack || \
	  send_packed_data__echo_back_as_response || send_packed_data__echo_back_as_event
	]
```
For example,
```sh
$ sudo ./test.out get_wifi_mode
```

### Some points to note
- Connect to AP in station mode
  - After `sta_connect`, User needs to run the DHCP client to obtain an IP address from an external AP. Then network data path will be open for higher applications to use `ethsta0` interface for data communication. For an example as below.

  ```sh
  $ sudo killall dhclient      # kill earlier dhclient processes
  $ sudo dhclient ethsta0 -v   # Run DHCP client to get IP from AP/Router
  ```

- Disconnect AP in station mode
  - After disconnect, user can remove DHCP lease. For example,

  ```sh
  $ sudo dhclient ethsta0 -r     # clean-up earlier assigned DHCP IP
  and
    $ sudo killall dhclient      # kill earlier dhclient processes

  ```

- For softAP vendor specific IE
  - `set_softap_vendor_ie` will be in effect only if it is done before starting of ESP softAP
  - Once vendor IE set, consecutive `set_softap_vendor_ie` will fail unless vendor IE is reset using `reset_softap_vendor_ie` or ESP reboot
- SoftAP start
  - After `softap_start` to start data connection, set up a DHCP server on the Raspberry Pi, or configure a static IP address for AP interface (`ethap0`). For an example as below:

  ```sh
  $ sudo dnsmasq --no-daemon --no-resolv --no-poll --dhcp-script=/system/bin/dhcp_announce --dhcp-range=192.168.4.1,192.168.4.20,1h

  $ sudo ifconfig ethap0 192.168.4.5
  ```

- SoftAP stop
  - After stopping softAP, dnsmasq could be down/killed as per user expectation

- OTA
  - The OTA update using C currently assumes the complete binary is downloaded locally
  - OTA update using HTTP URL is only supported in [python demo app](python_demo.md#ota-update)
  - In case HTTP based OTA update is desired, user can do the same using third party HTTP client library

  ```sh
  ex.
  ./test.out ota </path/to/ota_image.bin>
  ```

- Set Wi-Fi max transmit power
  - This is just a request to Wi-Fi driver. The actual power set may slightly differ from exact requested power.

## 2. Stress Testing Application (stress.c)

[stress.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/stress.c) is used for internal stress testing of control path APIs. It is similar to the demo app but additionally allows multiple iteration testing.

### Source files
- Source files are [stress.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/stress.c) and [test_utils.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/test_utils.c)
- Config file : [ctrl_config.h](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/ctrl_config.h)

### How to run
- Change expected configuration from config file
- Run `make stress` in [c_support](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support) directory to compile `stress.c`.
- Please execute `stress.out` as below.

```sh
$ sudo ./stress.out <Number of test iterations> [get_sta_mac_addr] [get_softap_mac_addr] \
		[set_sta_mac_addr] [set_softap_mac_addr] [get_wifi_mode] [set_wifi_mode] \
		[get_ap_scan_list] [sta_connect] [get_sta_config] [sta_disconnect] \
		[set_softap_vendor_ie] [reset_softap_vendor_ie] [softap_start] \
		[get_softap_config] [softap_connected_sta_list] [softap_stop] \
		[set_wifi_powersave_mode] [get_wifi_powersave_mode] [set_wifi_max_tx_power] \
		[get_wifi_curr_tx_power] [set_country_code] [set_country_code_enabled] [get_country_code] \
		[ota </path/to/esp_firmware_network_adaptor.bin>]

For example:
$ sudo ./stress.out 10 scan sta_connect sta_disconnect ap_start sta_list ap_stop wifi_tx_power
```

## 3. Interactive Shell Application (hosted_shell.c)

[hosted_shell.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/hosted_shell.c) provides an interactive shell interface for controlling the ESP device. It offers a more user-friendly way to interact with the device through a command-line shell with features like command auto-completion, and hints.


### Features
- Interactive command-line interface
- Tab completion for commands and arguments
- Command hints
- Help documentation for all commands

### How to build and run

###### replxx
`replxx` is used as command line processor which is shell handler. You are free to change to your preffered shell handler.

You need to install replxx by following GitHub page, https://github.com/AmokHuginnsson/replxx.

```sh
# install replxx software from above link first
$ make hosted_shell
$ sudo ./hosted_shell.out
```

In the shell, you can type double tab to see all available commands

## 4. Network Management Daemon (hosted_daemon.c)

[hosted_daemon.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/hosted_daemon.c) implements a background daemon that manages network interfaces for ESP device. It handles network events and automatically configures interfaces based on events from the ESP device.

### Features
- Runs as a daemon in the background
- Automatically manages network interfaces
- Handles DHCP and DNS configuration
- Responds to network state changes from ESP device

### How to build and run
```sh
$ make hosted_daemon
$ sudo ./hosted_daemon.out
```

To run in foreground mode (for debugging):
```sh
$ sudo ./hosted_daemon.out -f
```

# Custom RPC Communication (app_custom_rpc.c)

[app_custom_rpc.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/app_custom_rpc.c) demonstrates how to use the Custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functionality of ESP Hosted. This allows application-specific communication between the host and ESP device.

### Features
- Demonstrates custom communication between host and ESP device
- Allows sending events and requests with custom data
- Shows how to handle custom responses and events

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Provides APIs for sending packed data between host and ESP device.
> 2. User is responsible for serializing data before sending and deserializing after receiving.

### Example Demo Functions
- `custom_rpc_demo1_request_only_ack`: Sends a request with only acknowledgement (uses `CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ONLY_ACK`)
- `custom_rpc_demo2_request_echo_back_as_response`: Sends data and receives an echo back as response (uses `CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ECHO_BACK_RESPONSE`)
- `custom_rpc_demo3_request_echo_back_as_event`: Sends data and receives echo back as an event (uses `CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ECHO_BACK_AS_EVENT` and `CUSTOM_RPC_EVENT_ID__DEMO_ECHO_BACK_REQUEST`)

These demos are integrated in applications like `test.out` and `hosted_shell.out` and demonstrate the complete flow of custom RPC communication between host and ESP device.
It uses underlying control path API for reliable communication.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Current APIs discussed can carry your own 'packed' data from host to slave or vice versa. If you need pure serialised message handling, you can add new message in esp_hosted_config.proto and handle similar to other existing RPC protobuf messages

### Adding New Application-Specific RPC

1. Get ready with your own packed data in bytes. **The data would be assumed to be already serialized**, outside knowledge of ESP-Hosted
2. User can extend functionalities to add new user request IDs and Event IDs in file [esp_hosted_custom_rpc.h](../../host/linux/host_control/include/esp_hosted_custom_rpc.h)
3. Implementation of **host handlers** & adding own message types:
- Header
  - Use the provided APIs in `esp_hosted_custom_rpc.h` to send and receive custom RPC data
  - Optionally add new Request or Event IDs to the existing enums:
    ```c
    typedef enum {
        CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ONLY_ACK = 1,
        CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ECHO_BACK_RESPONSE,
        CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ECHO_BACK_AS_EVENT,
        /* Add your custom request IDs here */
    } custom_rpc_req_id_e;

    typedef enum {
        CUSTOM_RPC_EVENT_ID__DEMO_ECHO_BACK_REQUEST = 1,
        /* Add your custom event IDs here */
    } custom_rpc_event_id_e;
    ```

- Host
  - Add your custom `requests` or `events` in [app_custom_rpc.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/app_custom_rpc.c) and [app_custom_rpc.h](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/app_custom_rpc.h).
  - Optionally, add your own Request and Message ID handling functions similar to the existing demo functions
  > [!CAUTION]
  >
  > 1. The handlers in these requests should be as concise as possible.
  > 2. Although it is not interrupt context, try not to have blocking calls in the response handler, as this function is called as callback.
- Slave
  - In [slave_control.c](../../esp/esp_driver/network_adapter/main/slave_control.c), the default response handler for underlying RPC request handler is called with:
  ```c
  register_custom_rpc_unserialised_req_handler()
  ```
  - [esp_hosted_coprocessor.c](../../esp/esp_driver/network_adapter/main/esp_hosted_coprocessor.c): The default response handler for these requests is handled with:
  ```c
  register_custom_rpc_unserialised_req_handler(handle_custom_unserialised_rpc_request);
  ```
  - For your own message IDs, add cases in `handle_custom_unserialised_rpc_request()`
  > [!CAUTION]
  >
  > 1. The handlers in these requests should be as concise as possible.
  > 2. Although it is not interrupt context, try not to have blocking calls in the response handler, as this function is called as callback.
  - You can also trigger events instead of immediate responses as demonstrated in `CUSTOM_RPC_REQ_ID__ECHO_BACK_AS_EVENT`
  - To add your own event, you can re-use `create_and_send_custom_rpc_unserialised_event()`
